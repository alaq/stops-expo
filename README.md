Stops is an iOS and Android app that let's you choose a destination and notifies when you've reached it. You can use Stops to wake you up from a nap on your way to work or help you get to a destination which you have never commuted to. The app uses geofencing and background geolocation only when you're in transit. It also plays well with Google Maps and Apple Maps.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).
